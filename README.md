  Have you ever wanted to get mentioned on Discord on a certain time?<br>
  Maybe you even wanted to see a small note from your past self in there?<br>
  That's what this code was written for!<br>
  Made it for my small discord server as a fun way to learn MongoDB.<br>
  All the code was written by me.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

To self-host this project for free:
1. Create a new application on https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Create a new bot in the application.
3. Add the bot to a server and get the bot's token and the server's target bot channel's ID.
4. Create a free cluster on https://www.mongodb.com/ and get its log in link and password. Customize the link to the format given below.
5. Create a database and three collections inside it. First one is for future reminders, second one is for past reminders, third one is for user profiles.
6. Create a project on https://replit.com and connect it with your fork of this repository (or manually copy the files there).
7. Create replit environment variables described below and fill them with your values.
8. Run the code on replit and copy the link of the created website.
9. Create a new monitor on https://uptimerobot.com/ on the link of your aforementioned website. Keep the other parameters at default values.

üéá Done! The bot is ready to use. üéá

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face:
