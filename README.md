## General Information
This is a project that was a previous recruitment task of mine. I fixed the points mentioned in the feedback and added dockerization, a CI/CD pipeline on SemaphoreCI, gunicorn, and changed hosting from pythonanywhere to heroku.
The project is a books API. It provides a feature to upload books from Google Books API to the database, and browse them, either with filters or without them.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.9.12
- Django 4.0.3
- Django REST Framework 3.13.1 
- PostgreSQL 14.2
- Gunicorn 20.1.0
- Docker
- SemaphoreCI
- Heroku


## üöÄ Features
The recruitment task demanded such features and all are provided in a required format:
- accessing /books displays all stored books,
- accessing /books?published_date=1995 displays stored books published in a certain year,
- accessing /books?sort=-published_date displays all stored books sorted by published date in descending order,
- accessing /books?author=author1&author=author2 displays all stored books written by author1 and all stored books written by author2,
- accessing /books/<book_id> displays details of a single book of id <book_id>,
- sending a POST request to /db with a "q" keyword adds 10 books to the API's database; the books come from a query sent to the Google Books API with the passed keyword and the operation will update existing ones if there are such.

Furthermore, the API is deployed on Heroku from a Docker image using a CI/CD SemaphoreCI pipeline:
